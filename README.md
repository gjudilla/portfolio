## Description

Using the skills I recently gained from my HTML and CSS courses in my coding bootcamp, I created an interactive Portfolio webpage so that any visitors to my site can learn more about me, click through my projects and resume, and have a means to contact me.

## Usage

To use this webpage, click the links on the navigation bar to move through the page and reach the designated sections of the page. Browse the content on the webpage to learn more about me, click through my recent projects, and contact me. Click each image in the Projects Page to see my deployed projects. Send me a message or reach out to me by filling out the inputs on the Contact Me section. Note: form is not currently functional and LinkedIn/resume is not up to date.
